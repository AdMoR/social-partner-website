### [Demo with current state of backend implementation and with complete frontend](https://react-redux-realworld-play-backend.stackblitz.io/#/)
### [Referential demo](https://react-redux.realworld.io/)

This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged fullstack application built with **Scala & Play Framework** including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more.

We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the **Scala & Play Framework** community styleguides & best practices.

For more information on how to this works with other frontends/backends, head over to the [RealWorld](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld) repo.
